# YouScreen
Post an ad or say something.
## Introduction
The aim of the project is to place monitors at busy public places on which everyone can pay to publish their own advertisment. Everyone will be able to show their ad on the screen for less than 10 minutes.*

YouScreen could be very useful and beneficial for all sorts of businesses that aims to reach a wider audience. 
YouScreen could also be a great opportunity for anyone who wants to sell something or promote their services(cars, properties, jewelry, cleaning services, accounting servicess etc.)
The clients would be charged for the time their announcement is shown on one of the screens. Every YouScreen could contain several advertisment sub-windows depending on the size of the screen. 

The greatest advantage of YouScreen would be it's transparency and high reliability. Every customer buying an ad slot will be able to check if their ad is shown on the right place at the booked time. For example, if someone pays for an hour long advertisment or announcement to be shown between 5pm and 6pm it will be visualised for 20 seconds every 5 minutes on one of the 6 windows of the YouScreen chosen.

Another important advantage of YouScreen that is worth considering is the various set of possibilities it offers. Every YouScreen monitor could have a unique QR code which would allow customers to scan the code and publish an ad or announcement. Clients will be able to chose the best timeslot and duration of their ad.

Publishing an ad would be very easy and affordable for everyone. Small businesses and retailers do not have many opportunities for advertising as the prices of the ads on TV, online, bilboards or newspapers can be very high. Transparancy and affordability when using YouScreen should be a great motivation for small and medium sized enterprises. If a shop for example sells very interesting and unique products but is not located on the high street, most of the people living nearby will probably never find out that the shop is in their neighbourhood. In such situations YouScreen could be the perfect decision to attract more customers living in the area or visitors.

People with freelance jobs are also disadvantaged because of the expensive ads.
