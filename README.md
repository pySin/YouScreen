# YouScreen
Post an ad or say something.
## Introduction
The aim of the project is to put monitors at busy public places where everyone will be able to pay and publish their own advertisement or announcement and show their ad on the screen for less than 10 minutes.*

YouScreen could be useful and beneficial for all sorts of businesses that aim to reach out to a wider audience. 
YouScreen could be also a great opportunity for anyone willing to sell something or promote their services (cars, properties, jewellery, cleaning services, accounting services etc.)
Clients will be charged only for the time during which their announcement is being shown on the screen. Every YouScreen could contain several advertisement or sub-windows, depending on the size of the screen itself. 

The greatest advantage of YouScreen would be its transparency and high reliability. Every customer, who buys his ad slot, will be able to check if their ad is shown on the right place and at the time he booked. For example, if someone pays for their one hour advertisement or announcement to be shown between 5pm and 6pm, then the ad will be visualised for 20 seconds in every 5 minutes on one of the 6 windows of the YouScreen you have chosen.

Another important advantage of YouScreen that is worth considering is the wide range of possibilities that it offers. Every YouScreen monitor will have a unique QR code which allows customers to scan the code and then publish their ad or announcement. Furthermore, clients will be able to choose both the time slot and duration of their own ad.

Publishing ads would be very easy and affordable for all types of customers. Small businesses and retailers do not have many opportunities for advertising as prices for ads shown on TV, online, or on billboards and newspapers can be really very high nowadays. Transparency and affordability of YouScreens could be a great motivation for small and medium sized enterprises. If a shop, for example, sells some interesting and unique products but is not centrally located or on an important high street, most of the people living nearby, who are its potential target, will probably never find out that this shop is actually in their neighbourhood. In such situations, YouScreen could be the perfect decision especially when it comes to attracting more local customers or visitors.

People with freelance jobs are in many ways disadvantaged when it comes to expensive ads. Musicians, painters, photographers and many others are constrained to mainly advertise their services on online platforms, where, however, accountability and correctness are difficult to be traced.

Likewise, YouScreen could be of interest to event organisers. Events usually take place at certain time and venue. Event organisers could easily decide in which area/areas they would like to place their ads and set them appear only a week before the planed event, for example. Thus, expenses related to printing services and poster distributions can be easily avoided. Another thing to highlight here is that ads on YouScreen will be much more ecologically friendly than ads on paper or fleers, for example.

* The ad should be submitted and approved beforhand.
